Sector-84: Rain Forest
A former oxidium production facility following a long sewage system,
but now abandoned and forgotten by the grenarcs.
this sector usally receives a high number of rain fall every year and hence also has a great number of tree.
and it can be estimated that these wrecks are at youngest 15 years old, if measured looking at the oldest trees located there.
